##After being [raided](1) by the police almost two months ago, (in)famous torrent website The Pirate Bay is now back online. Those who thought the website will never return will be either disappointed or happy given that The Pirate Bay seems to live once again.

In order to celebrate its coming back, The Pirate Bay admins have posted a Phoenix bird on the front page, which signifies the fact that the website can't be killed only damaged.

About two weeks after The Pirate Bay was raided the domain miraculously came back to life. Soon after a countdown appeared on the temporary homepage of The Pirate Bay indicating that the website is almost ready for a comeback.

The countdown hinted to February 1, as the possible date for The Pirate Bay's comeback, but it looks like those who manage the website manage to pull it out one day earlier.

Beginning today, those who have accounts on The Pirate Bay can start downloading the torrents they want. Other than the Phoenix on the front page there are no other messages that might point to the resurrection The Pirate Bay except for the fact that it's now operational.

Admins of the website said a few weeks ago they will find ways to manage and optimize The Pirate Bay, so that there will be minimal chances for the website to be closed once again. Let's see how it lasts this time.

##Another version of The Pirate Bay may be launched soon

In related news, one of the members of the original staff was dissatisfied with the decisions made by the majority regarding some of the changes made in the way admins interact with the website.

He told [Torrentfreak](2) earlier this week that he, along with a few others, will open his version of The Pirate Bay, which they claim will be the "real" one.
